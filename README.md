## Motivation

From a youtube channel, where I have learned python and many other things always start any new topic by stating the motivation for the topic and why he is teaching it. So i also want to do so hope it helps me to complete the whole project from start to finish and i do not leave it at some point.
From a long time I like to read books, not the books that my syllabus required but the books that has a story of dragons, hobbits, new world, and etc but as my family is poor and according to them i should first complete my own book before diving into new books that i wanted to buy so i fill my time with the stories written in my hindi and english literature books. Then I found out internet (yes I am somewhat bum compared to the people who uses internet from the day born) where there's thousand of stories just free to read its like a treasure trove so when i bought my first mobile the only thing i used it for reading web novels, pdf, and many more.(thats the reason i got so less marks in my hs ) Any way thats the reason i want to create an app that will help me publish some of own story and share the love of writting and reading with people.
